# SpaceTraceMünster
Mapping of moving people on different spots in Münster (normal going/ tracing ->parkour and freerunning)

-aim: to analyze structures for my bachelor thesis, develop space concepts
-way: 1.step: filming moving people on spots for hours (passerbys/ tracers)
      2.step: translate the results into data
      3.step: visualize data into space concepts
-programs: runkeeper, runtastic, rhinoceros 4d, grasshopper, firefly, maya
-priority: space arrangements between passerbys and tracers (parkour and freerunning)

questions: How can I translate the videos into digital frequencies ? (lines) 
           Are there others ways to get an adequate documentation?
